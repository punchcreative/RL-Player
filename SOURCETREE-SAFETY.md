## 🛡️ **SourceTree Safety Rules**

### **Before Making Any Changes**:

1. **Always Check Current Branch**:

   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   # Should show: dev
   ```

2. **Verify Clean State**:

   ```bash
   git status
   # Should show: "working tree clean"
   ```

3. **Commit Before Switching**:
   ```bash
   # If you have changes:
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your description"
   ```

### **Safe Branch Switching in SourceTree**:

1. **Check for Uncommitted Changes**: Look at "File Status" tab
2. **Commit First**: Never switch with uncommitted changes
3. **Use dev Branch**: This is your safest, most up-to-date branch
4. **Avoid v1.4.9**: Has merge conflicts - stay away for now

## 🚨 **Prevent SourceTree Conflicts**

### **DO THIS** ✅:

- **Work on dev branch** (currently active)
- **Commit frequently** with descriptive messages
- **Check "File Status" before switching branches**
- **Use "Stage All" → "Commit" workflow**

### **DON'T DO THIS** ❌:

- **Don't switch branches with uncommitted changes**
- **Don't force push (avoid `--force` flag)**
- **Don't work on v1.4.9 branch (has conflicts)**
- **Don't merge branches in SourceTree** (use command line if needed)

## 📋 **Your Safe Workflow**

### **Daily Development** (Recommended):

1. **Stay on dev branch** ✅
2. **Make your changes in VS Code**
3. **Test at http://localhost:3000/**
4. **Commit in SourceTree**:
   - Check "File Status" tab
   - Stage changed files
   - Write commit message
   - Click "Commit"
5. **Push to origin/dev** (green up arrow)

### **File Structure** (All Protected):
