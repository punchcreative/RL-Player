(https://github.com/jailsonsb2/RadioPlayer-All-Streams/blob/main/js/script.js)

## Features

- Current song display
- History of played songs
- Songs coming up
- Responsive design
- Progressive Web App (PWA)
- Password protection for secure access

## Quick Setup

### 1. **RECOMMENDED: Environment Variables (.env) - Secure & Easy**

Environment variables provide the perfect balance of security and simplicity:

```bash
# Run the environment setup script
./setup-env.sh
```

**Benefits:**

- ‚úÖ **Secure**: Passwords stored outside of code
- ‚úÖ **Git Safe**: .env automatically ignored
- ‚úÖ **User Friendly**: Simple key=value format
- ‚úÖ **Industry Standard**: Used by most web applications

### 2. **ALTERNATIVE: Interactive Setup Utility**

For a visual setup experience:

```bash
# Open setup.html in your browser
open setup.html
```

### 3. **Configuration Guide**

After choosing your setup method:

- ‚úÖ Check configuration status
- üîê Generate secure password hash
- üìª Configure your radio station settings
- üìÅ Get your complete config.js file
- ‚úÖ Test your player

### Alternative: Manual Setup

If you prefer manual configuration:

1. **Copy the config template:**

   ```bash
   cp config.example.js config.js
   ```

2. **Generate your password hash:**

   - Open browser Developer Tools (F12) ‚Üí Console
   - Run: `await hashString("your-password-here")`
   - Copy the resulting hash

3. **Edit config.js with your settings:**

   ```javascript
   const CONFIG = {
     PASSWORD_HASH: "your-generated-hash-here",

     APP_CONFIG: {
       // PWA Settings
       scope: "/your-app-path/",
       background_color: "#your-color",
       theme_color: "#your-color",

       // Radio Station Settings
       station_name: "Your Radio Name",
       stream_url: "https://your-stream-url.com",
       app_url: "https://your-domain.com/app/",

       // Audio Settings
       default_volume: 100,
       dim_volume_sleep_timer: 50,
     },
   };
   ```

4. **Never commit config.js to Git** - it's already in .gitignore for security

### 2. Legacy Configuration (Optional)

If you don't use the CONFIG.APP_CONFIG, the player will fall back to `manifest.json` values:

- `"custom_radio_config"`: Radio station settings
- `"background_color"`: PWA background color
- `"theme_color"`: PWA theme color
- `"scope"`: PWA URL scope

**Note:** Using CONFIG.APP_CONFIG is recommended as it keeps your settings secure and separate from the repository.

### 3. Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Follow the configuration setup above (use setup.html for easiest setup)
3. Configure your radio settings in config.js
4. Customize your graphics (see Graphics Customization below)
5. Upload to your web server

### 4. Graphics Customization

You can customize the visual appearance of your radio player by replacing the default graphics:

#### Required Images:

- **`img/app-icon.png`** - App icon used for:

  - PWA home screen icon
  - Browser tab favicon
  - App launcher icon on mobile devices
  - **Recommended size:** 512x512px (PNG format)

- **`img/cover.png`** - Station logo/cover image used for:
  - Main player display background
  - Media session artwork (lock screen, notifications)
  - Default album art when no track-specific art is available
  - **Recommended size:** 200x200px or larger (PNG/JPG format)

#### How to Customize:

1. **Replace the files** with your own graphics using the same filenames
2. **Keep the same file paths** (`img/app-icon.png` and `img/cover.png`)
3. **Maintain square aspect ratio** for best results across all platforms
4. **Use high resolution** images for crisp display on all devices

**Tip:** The app-icon.png should work well at small sizes since it will be used as a favicon and app icon.
